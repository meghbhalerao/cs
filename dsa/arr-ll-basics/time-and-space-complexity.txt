Time Complexity 
Max time taken as a function of n
Order(n) - O(n) - this is the representation of time complexity
for accessing all elements in array
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{}
from the program code also we can find the time complexity
Time complexity is written in order of the max degree of the polynomial
Suppose something like the binary sort:
log(n) for binary search
Length of list being divided by 2 - then the time complexity is log(2)
Linked list ops are similar to that of array - and even time complexity is same
Binary tree searching given height n - log(n)
Time complexity depends on what work you are doing


Space complexity - function of space/storage taken by the data structure

For using code to calculate time complexity:
Find the time function using code - and see the highest degree polynomial
