Abstract data type:
datatype : operatons and representation of data
1 bit is sign bit and others are meant for storing numbers in integer data type data
Abstract means hiding internal details - operations are abstracted from the user - need not know how bitwise ops are performed. int and alll r primitive datatype
abstract data type : in OOPs
Representation of list can be done using array and linked list
Operations on list:
appending to list 
removing some elements 
search for an element 
Representation of all datatype as abstarct datatypes
Oprations on a list
Appending to the end of the list or beginning of a list 
Add an element at some given index - inserting an element at a given index
Removing or deleting an element from a given index
Set some value of some element at a given index or can be called as replacing an element
Get some element from a given index
Search for an element given the index, contains key - whether the key contains the element or not
Sort a numerical list
Split or combine list

C - array length decided during compile time
C++ - array length decided during runtime
Memory allocated for any varible defined in program is in stack
Heap memory accessed using pointers
p = new int[5] - C++
p = (int*) malloc(5*sizeof(int)); - C
malloc function typecasted to integer pointer pointing to the memory location using Heap
