/* Time complexity of a recursive function:
Recurrance relation using time complexity
Time Complexity - sum of all times taken measured in terms of number of units
T(n)  = T(n-1) + 2 - recurrance relation of time complexity - when n>0 since that is the condition
Can be solved by inducrtion method or recurrance reltion method
