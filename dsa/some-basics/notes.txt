Array can be created either inside stack or heap
Array memory locations are contiguous 
Linked list length can grow or reduce dynamically
Linked list always created in a heap
Head pointer can be in stack
Linked list size might or might not be known
The above two are physical data structures 
Physical data structures are meant for actually storing the data
How to perform the operations on those stored values??
These are decided by the logical data strcuture
Stack - LIFO 
Queue - FIFO
Trees - linear
Graph - non linear
Hash tables
Logical data structures are implemented using physical data structures
Implementatinon using arrays and linked lists
