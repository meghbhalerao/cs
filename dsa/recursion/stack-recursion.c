/* How does recusrion use stack?
We must always remember that the actrivation records for functions are stored 
in activation records which are stored in stack memory on one top of the other 
For normal recursive printing - number of calls is n+1 when the number of integers to be printed is n 
Recursive functions are memory cnonsuming functions
Activation records are created when the function is calling itself*/
